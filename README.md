# Kaetram

Kaetram is an open-source game-engine created to aid those interested in entering the game development realm. The codebase is simple, clean, and intuitive, and is intended to be used as a learning tool. The original idea is based off Little Workshop's demo game - BrowserQuest. The assets have remained the same, but the code itself has been completely wiped and redone from the ground up.


### What is included in this package:

- Custom map parsing software (automatically converts your map into parsable files).
- Images from the original installment of Kaetram.
- Ready-to-go Engine, just install dependencies and connect to MongoDB to go.
